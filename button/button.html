            This is some tips for the new users of this application:
            <br>
            When you are developing tasks to do, always bear in mind which tasks are critical to finish.
            <br>
            Also, you should be mindful of those tasks that requires a previous task to finish before they can start.
            <br>
            This is an example of the development method called critical path.
            <br>
            When you use critical path, your main focus is to get a product with functionality.
            <br>
            Everything else increase the value of the product,
            <br>
            but should be focused upon when the critical tasks have enough manpower.
            <br>
            Another tip is to create tasks of appropriate size.
            <br>
            Try to divide the tasks to as small as possible,
            <br>
            but not to make them so small that they are impractical.
            <br>
